<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>SERMON,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BY THE REV. HERBERT JAMES.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Remember them which have the rule over you
(are the guides), who have spoken unto you the Word of God: whose
faith follow, considering the end of their
conversation.&rdquo;&mdash;Heb. xiii. 7.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God&rsquo;s gifts to His Church are manifold.&nbsp; He has
given Christ and eternal life in Him.&nbsp; He has given the Word
of Christ, the precious casket which enshrines Him and His
salvation.&nbsp; He has given the Holy Ghost to lead us by the
Word Inspired to the Word Incarnate.&nbsp; And He has given
Christians indeed&mdash;men and women saved by
Christ&mdash;living embodiments of a living Saviour and a living
Word, through the living Spirit.</p>
<p>In all these gifts He has a special purpose in view.&nbsp;
They are not thrown at random into the world.&nbsp; God does
nothing aimlessly.</p>
<p>When He called this world of ours into being, and gave it its
proper place in the universe as the habitation for
man,&mdash;when He gathered up the light into the light-bearers,
and commanded them to be for signs, and for seasons, for days,
and years,&mdash;when He put the topstone to creation, and set
man upon the earth to be His representative,&mdash;in all this
there was nothing without design.&nbsp; &ldquo;He hath made His
wonderful works to be remembered.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>And so,
brethren, has He dealt in things of higher moment.&nbsp; When He
gave His Son, His Word, His Spirit, His people, there was a
meaning in each of these gifts.&nbsp; They are no
accidents.&nbsp; His choosing is for our using.&nbsp; His mercies
are for our minding.&nbsp; His gifts are for our gain, as well as
for the glory of His own grace.</p>
<p>Now, this is specially true of that great, but often
little-regarded, gift&mdash;<i>a Christian indeed</i>.&nbsp; It
is a mistake to suppose that such an one is here merely to work
out his own salvation, and heap up treasure for himself in the
world to come.</p>
<p>He is <i>not</i> here <i>for himself</i>.&nbsp; As an
unconverted man an end is to be served by his being.&nbsp; As a
converted man a far higher end is to be served by his being in
Christ.&nbsp; He is God&rsquo;s workmanship, God&rsquo;s
appointment <i>for others</i>;&mdash;a privilege for those
amongst whom he is placed; a light to see by; salt to be savoured
by; a leader to be marked; a guide to be followed.</p>
<p>The apostle recognises this truth in the scripture before
us.&nbsp; He is writing to a people whom he wishes to establish
in the faith.&nbsp; For this he plies them with motives, and
suggests means.&nbsp; In so doing he comes to set before them
those who were their guides in the faith.&nbsp; He urges them to
follow their example whilst living, to treasure their memory when
dead.&nbsp; They would find this a mighty help towards standing
fast.</p>
<p>Brethren, <i>we</i> are called to a like duty this day.&nbsp;
We are met together, the poorer, most of us, by a friend; the
richer, all of us, by a memory and an example.&nbsp; We have
had&mdash;we still have&mdash;a gift of God, in the person of His
sainted servant.&nbsp; We have had a real Christian to look upon
and live by.</p>
<p>Let us listen, then, to these words of earnest exhortation, <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>and
&ldquo;remember those who are the guides&mdash;following their
faith, and considering the end (the termination), of their
conversation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Will you not pray that God the Holy
Ghost may clothe His Word with new power, and enable me to speak
so as to glorify God&mdash;to quicken, to comfort, to edify
souls?</p>
<p>I propose more especially to take up the latter half of the
verse, and to mark&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">I.&nbsp; What God would have us <i>to
follow</i>;</p>
<p class="gutindent">II.&nbsp; What God would have us to
<i>consider</i>.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; <i>What is it</i>, <i>then</i>, <i>which God would
have us to follow</i>?&nbsp; The faith of those who are
&ldquo;guides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This leads me to observe <i>one view which every Christian
ought to take of his position</i>.&nbsp; He is called to be a
guide in the faith&mdash;by his life, if not by his words.</p>
<p>Now, brethren, I am aware that this is held to be almost
exclusively the duty of ministers.&nbsp; The text is usually so
applied.&nbsp; I have no wish to shift off the responsibility
from them.&nbsp; They, if any, ought to go before the
flock.&nbsp; Nor do I wish to put young Christians out of their
proper place.</p>
<p>But I do hold very strongly that this responsibility of
ministers is shared by all the servants of Christ.&nbsp; Whatever
their position&mdash;whatever their measure of grace or gifts,
they are called of God to lead on others in the faith, <i>in some
measure</i>.&nbsp; One star may differ from another star in
glory, or degree of brightness.&nbsp; One member of the body may
differ from another in size and shape.&nbsp; But the least star
has its place and power, and the least member its work and
fitness for that work (1 Cor. xii. 21, 22).&nbsp; And so of each
Christian.&nbsp; &ldquo;As every man hath received the gift, even
so minister the same one to another, as good stewards <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>of the manifold
grace of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Your standing as a Christian may not
be advanced.&nbsp; Your measure of grace, to your own thinking,
may be somewhat scant&mdash;but your working and example <i>up to
the extent of that grace</i>, are necessary for the well-being of
the whole body.&nbsp; To you, as well as to others, is this word
spoken &ldquo;Ye are my witnesses,&rdquo; and by you, as well as
by others, may comfort be afforded to some soul not yet gathered,
some sheep yet straying upon the dark mountains.&nbsp; None are
too small in God&rsquo;s sight to be useful.&nbsp; None are so
low down but they may help to lift up others.&nbsp; Every atom
has a shadow.&nbsp; Every Christian has an influence.&nbsp;
Believe me there is no such thing as an idle life&mdash;you are
either a blight or a blessing.</p>
<p>This, then, I say, is one view which every Christian ought to
take of his position.&nbsp; If he has faith, he has a faith to be
followed.&nbsp; And this, too, is the view which others are to
take of every such Christian.&nbsp; Wherever any such have
realised their high calling, and risen to it, there would God
have us remember them, and follow, or imitate, their faith.</p>
<p>But whilst I say this of all, it is emphatically true with
respect to those who, by the grace of God, were, <i>in faith</i>,
what they were.</p>
<p>Need I say that, until very lately, we had one in our midst
who <i>did</i> take a right view of his position, and who has
left a pattern of faith which we should be only too glad to
follow.</p>
<p>Looking at him as a Christian, I might justly use the words in
which his spiritual helper of former days (Bishop Wilson)
described Mr. Cecil: &ldquo;All the finer materials which
distinguished him as a man, were wrought up, if I may so say, and
sanctified by the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp; But as <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>it was more
especially as a <i>man of faith</i> that he stood out before the
world, it is in this character that I would ask you to look at
him.</p>
<p>And, here let me say once for all, that in speaking of him
to-day, I desire to speak of him as <i>God&rsquo;s
handywork</i>.</p>
<p>I have no wish to exalt the creature.&nbsp; You know how he
would have loathed any approach to that.&nbsp; But I do wish,
however faintly, to set forth what God&rsquo;s grace did for a
poor, weak, sinful, erring man, of like passions with us.&nbsp;
To that grace he owed all, and to the honour of that grace alone,
I ascribe all his eminence as a guide in the faith.</p>
<p><i>He believed through grace</i>.&nbsp; I am not aware of the
exact time, or of the exact circumstances of his conversion, but
I have reason to believe that for fifty years he had believed,
and known Him in whom he believed.</p>
<p>The <i>ground</i> and warrant of his faith was the sure Word
of God.</p>
<p>The <i>object</i> of it was <i>God in Christ</i>&mdash;a
reconciling Father, a sufficient Saviour, an ever-present
Counsellor and Comforter.&nbsp; He received that which was
delivered to him&mdash;as it is also to us&mdash;that
&ldquo;Christ died for our sins according to the
Scriptures.&rdquo;&nbsp; This all-perfect, all-satisfying
substitution and atonement of the Lord Jesus was from the first,
and to the last, the one foundation of his trust, the one source
of his life and strength.&nbsp; He felt this, and nothing less
than this, to be necessary.&nbsp; He found this, and this alone,
to be sufficient.&nbsp; He realised it.&nbsp; He rested on
it.&nbsp; He rejoiced in it.</p>
<p>For among the more leading features of his faith, these two
stand out:&mdash;its <i>fixedness</i>, and its
<i>joyousness</i>.</p>
<p><i>It was a fixed faith</i>.&nbsp; Having received the Word of
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>God, he
dealt with it as the Word of God.&nbsp; He submitted himself to
its declarations with the simplicity of a little child.&nbsp;
Where it warned, he took heed.&nbsp; Where it led, he
followed.&nbsp; Where it promised, he took hold.&nbsp; And so
having found it written therein that &ldquo;they who believe are
justified,&rdquo; he believed, and was justified.</p>
<p>His faith grew into a full assurance, for assurance is but
faith intensified.&nbsp; As such it wrought wondrously.&nbsp; By
it he became what he was.&nbsp; It helped him to choose for God,
and to be decided for the right.&nbsp; It enabled him to confess
Christ before man, and to be steadfast when others were
wavering.&nbsp; By this he overcame the world when it bid fair
and high for his service, and by this he attempted not a few
things for God, in a day when there were but few to stand by
him.&nbsp; From this came his calmness in the midst of trouble,
and from this his confidence in the hour of death.&nbsp; For thus
he could say whilst passing into eternity:&mdash;&ldquo;Were it
not for mercy I should be lost; but by the mercy of God in Christ
<i>I am saved</i>.&nbsp; Wonderful!&rdquo;&nbsp; And again,
&ldquo;What <i>should</i> I do without Christ.&nbsp; Such a poor
sinner! but complete and accepted in the Beloved!&nbsp; Such a
sure foundation.&nbsp; Such a great salvation!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;He will never leave me nor forsake me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am complete in Him!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>It was a joyous faith</i>.&nbsp; He did not barely know and
assent, and rely&mdash;he <i>delighted</i>.&nbsp; Christ was the
joy of his soul as well as the soul of his joys.&nbsp; His heart
ran over with gladness as he thought of the freeness and
sufficiency of the great Salvation.&nbsp; The grace that brought
it&mdash;the power that wrought it&mdash;the blood which bought
him for it&mdash;and the love which taught him how to use
it&mdash;were the subjects of his unceasing thankfulness and
praise.</p>
<p>The result of all this was a very sunny Christianity.&nbsp; He
was not without his trials&mdash;what Christian is?&nbsp; But, <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>with all, he
seemed to have real enjoyment of his religion.&nbsp; The good
news was good news to him, and he shewed it.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
joyed in God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O for a few more Christians of the same sort&mdash;men and
women who believe, and live as if they believed!&nbsp; What a
reproach would be rolled from the faith if we could but hold up
our heads a little more!&nbsp; We do not want any alteration of
doctrine to make Christian truth more attractive, but we do want
more attractive cheerfulness in those who believe and know that
truth.</p>
<p>Such, then, brethren in outline at least, is the faith which
you and I are to follow.&nbsp; God would have us remember this
guide, who thus spoke to us His word, and imitate, or copy, his
faith.</p>
<p><i>Are you</i>, <i>at this present speaking</i>, <i>an
unbeliever</i>?&nbsp; Solemnly and personally, God calls upon you
to believe.&nbsp; Do not say that it is out of the question for
such an one as you are.&nbsp; Here was one who, like yourself,
was once a stranger to God.&nbsp; But he obtained mercy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant toward him in
faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; That grace is offered to you&mdash;can work
in you.&nbsp; Go to God for it as he went.&nbsp; You are invited
to come.&nbsp; He is waiting to be gracious.&nbsp; He cannot deny
you.&nbsp; Tell Him that you have come in Christ&rsquo;s name,
for the blessedness of those who know the joyful sound, and you
will go forth walking in the light of His countenance.</p>
<p><i>Are you weak in faith</i>?&nbsp; Be encouraged by this
example, to believe more fixedly, more confidently.&nbsp; You
have the same warrant, the same ground for your faith to rest
upon&mdash;the word of truth, the Gospel of your Salvation.&nbsp;
That assures you that all is done for you,&mdash;that a double
punishment has been laid for you upon the Surety,&mdash;a double
satisfaction rendered on your behalf by Him <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>(Isaiah xl.,
2), &ldquo;Look at Christ set before you in the Gospel, and faith
will come into exercise.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then you will come to rest
where our departed friend rested.&nbsp; It is no impossible
attainment, no act of presumption.&nbsp; When the Lord is saying
&ldquo;Eat, O friends, yea drink&mdash;drink abundantly, O
beloved,&rdquo; surely we ought not to reply to His large-hearted
offers with any other response than a large-hearted
confidence.</p>
<p>And you, brethren, <i>who are walking in the steps of this
faith</i>, set it still before you.&nbsp; Be not slothful.&nbsp;
Follow on.&nbsp; Carry out this principle of foundation-faith
which I have been illustrating.</p>
<p><i>You have still much to gain</i>.&nbsp; You can never sit
down like the conqueror in old day who wept because there were no
more worlds to conquer.&nbsp; There remaineth yet much land to be
possessed.&nbsp; There are many enemies to be overcome.&nbsp;
There is much grace to be attained to.&nbsp; There is a closer
intimacy and fellowship with the Lord Jesus to be won.&nbsp; For
all this faith must be in action.</p>
<p><i>You have still much to meet</i>.&nbsp;
Duties&mdash;decisions&mdash;disappointments&mdash;cares&mdash;troubles.&nbsp;
The pressure will be great both from within and from
without.&nbsp; You have to learn better how to refer all things
to a spiritual standard&mdash;how to commit everything to the
guidance of a faithful and present God&mdash;how to endure as
seeing Him who is invisible.&nbsp; For all this faith must be
increased.&nbsp; It is the only secret of power.</p>
<p>If you aim at this, suffer me to remind you of that in our
departed friend which tended to make his faith what it was.</p>
<p>No plant of righteousness can grow without being nourished in
secret.&nbsp; No Christian soul can thrive unless <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>it be fed
from hidden sources.&nbsp; Our friend knew this, and therefore
largely used those &ldquo;nether springs&rdquo; of the Word of
God and prayer.&nbsp; He loved both.&nbsp; With both his hand was
diligent, and by this diligence he was made rich.</p>
<p>But it is of his <i>habit of prayer</i> that I would more
particularly speak.&nbsp; The flame of his faith was fed by the
oil of prayer.&nbsp; He had &ldquo;the gift of the
knees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of him it might be truly said that he gave himself unto
prayer.&nbsp; Late at night and early in the morning was he known
to be pleading before the Throne.&nbsp; His voice was indeed that
of Jacob, and so the faith and the walk were those of Enoch.</p>
<p>Oh, brethren&mdash;one great spring of sure and successful
believing lies in sustained secret prayer.&nbsp; When the one
wanes, the other withers.&nbsp; When the hands droop Amalek
prevails.&nbsp; Many a lost jewel of assurance&mdash;of
comfort&mdash;of usefulness, must be looked for in the place
where you dropped it&mdash;your place of prayer.&nbsp; If, then,
you would believe more, pray more.&nbsp; Gird yourselves afresh
to His work.&nbsp; Open your mouth wide and God will fill
it.&nbsp; Why remain poor with a boundless treasury to draw
upon?</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; I pass now from what God would have us follow, to
<i>what He would have us to consider</i>, viz.:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">I.&nbsp; <i>The conversation</i> of those
who are guides.</p>
<p class="gutindent">II.&nbsp; <i>The end of that
conversation</i>.</p>
<p>If the faith of God&rsquo;s people is to be marked, so also is
the fruit of it.&nbsp; We have seen the principle.&nbsp; We have
now to see the practice which followed from it.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; Let me notice however that the word
&ldquo;conversation&rdquo; does not mean merely
&ldquo;speech&rdquo; or &ldquo;talk.&rdquo;&nbsp; It refers to
the whole character, life, and walk: to the &lsquo;ins&rsquo; and
&lsquo;outs;&rsquo; the turnings and windings of the life.&nbsp;
So that in <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>these words we are called upon to act as if we had to
survey a country from a height&mdash;to trace a line of coast,
and to mark it until it passes off, and is lost to sight in the
distance.</p>
<p>Now I am bold to say that, through God&rsquo;s abounding grace
and power, the conversation we are this day called to consider is
a fair prospect indeed.</p>
<p>Taking a rapid general view of his character, I would say,
that <i>to him to live was Christ</i>.&nbsp; Christ was the
principle, the power, the pattern, of his life.</p>
<p>Entering more into detail, I would say that the character has
been sketched out for us by a master-hand.&nbsp; If you look at
the epistle for the day (Romans xii., 6&ndash;16) you will see
what I mean.</p>
<p>Look where you will, you can but say that God did all things
well in him&mdash;the Holy Ghost filled him with His fruit.</p>
<p>You know full well what his purpose and manner of life
was.&nbsp; As a representative&mdash;a magistrate&mdash;a
landlord&mdash;a master&mdash;a neighbour&mdash;there was always
the same Christian consistency&mdash;the same unworldliness of
spirit.&nbsp; Well did he carry out the injunction of a dying
father&mdash;&ldquo;See, my son, that you render unto C&aelig;sar
the things that are C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s, and unto God the things
that are God&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of his more private life I will only say that he was taught of
God to fill up every relationship, and in each one to show whose
beauty and comeliness were put upon him.</p>
<p>If however, I am still to select those features of character
which were most prominently marked&mdash;the jutting headlands
(so to speak) of that fair line of coast, his life&mdash;I would
name these two: 1, <i>Meekness of humility</i>; 2, <i>Tenderness
</i><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span><i>of
unselfish love</i>.&nbsp; As to both of these, he had drunk
deeply into the spirit of his Master.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Well was the mind of the meek and lowly Jesus
reflected in the life of His meekly humble servant.</p>
<p>Humility was his clothing&mdash;no mere ornament on
him&mdash;he was clothed with it, and oh how real and deep it
was!&nbsp; To the eye of others there was much in which he might
have gloried.&nbsp; Glory he did, but only as a
Christian&mdash;only in the Lord&mdash;only in the Lord&rsquo;s
Cross.</p>
<p>Throughout life there was the most utter self-abasement.&nbsp;
Never was he unwilling to be nothing that Christ might be
all.&nbsp; Never was he unmindful of the Rock from which he had
been hewn.&nbsp; Never could any complain of him that they could
not see Christ over his head.</p>
<p>But most strikingly did his deep self-abasement come out at
the close of life.</p>
<p>When asked if prayer should be offered for him, his words
were: &ldquo;Say nothing in my praise, all to the grace of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;People may say that I have been a good
man.&nbsp; I have been but a poor sinner.&nbsp; I have left
undone much that I ought to have done.&nbsp; O Lord! my goodness
extendeth not to Thee.&nbsp; Even if I could say, &lsquo;I have
walked in my integrity,&rsquo; nothing but free redemption
<i>has</i> saved me, and <i>could</i> save me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a poor sinner, and nothing at all; Jesus Christ
is my all in all.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A poor sinner in myself,
but pardoned and accepted in the Beloved Son of God.&nbsp;
Amen.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truly brethren, here was the humility which, whilst it disowns
and discrowns self, puts the crown fully on the head which is
worthy to wear it.&nbsp; There is no affection.&nbsp; Nothing but
the outpouring of the sincerest convictions of the soul, telling
us on the one hand that no flesh shall glory in His
presence&mdash;on the other that the soul shall make her boast in
the Lord.</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>2.&nbsp; Nor was the <i>tender unselfish love</i> less
remarkable than the humility.</p>
<p>He realised in an uncommon degree the love shown in the coming
and death of the Lord Jesus.&nbsp; The thought of it would often
melt his soul and overpower him for the time.</p>
<p>Now, <i>such</i> love, <i>so</i> realised, will always produce
the reality of love.&nbsp; No doubt there was much of tender
feeling and deep affection in the natural character.&nbsp; But
these were increased a thousand fold by Grace.&nbsp; You could
not look at him without being struck by this.&nbsp; His heart
looked out at his eyes, and that look was a whole sermon upon
love.</p>
<p>Nor was it a mere sentiment.&nbsp; Love, to be love, must act,
and you know the forms which that action took in his case.</p>
<p>He loved and cared much for the bodies of men.&nbsp; Many of
you now present can testify to this.&nbsp; Many hereafter will
rise up and call him blessed.</p>
<p>But he loved and cared for <i>souls</i> more.&nbsp; Nothing
could exceed the affectionate desirousness or the overflowing
tenderness of his love for sinners.&nbsp; By every means in his
power he would labour to bring Christ to them, or them to
Christ.&nbsp; I cannot dwell upon all the means he used.&nbsp;
His care to appoint godly ministers over the churches for which
he was a trustee&mdash;his open-handed support of every society
which put Christ in His right place&mdash;these are as well known
to you as to me.</p>
<p>I would rather recall his personal efforts to make known the
Gospel which was his own life.</p>
<p>Many of you, brethren, can bear me witness that by the space
of many years he did not shun to declare by lip and life, by word
and walk, the whole counsel of God.</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>He was
emphatically one of that class who, to use the words of a poor
man in London, &ldquo;carry their religion to other
people&rsquo;s houses.&rdquo;&nbsp; You know how he exhorted, and
comforted, and taught; and that nothing made him an happy as the
telling out the story of the Cross, or seeing the change which it
could work upon the soul.</p>
<p>What a striking instance of the activity of his love was given
in one of his dying testimonies:&mdash;&ldquo;Whilst I have power
to speak it must be of Salvation for ever and ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this life was as unselfish as it was active.&nbsp; As
Christ pleaded not Himself, so did His servant strive to
act.&nbsp; There was no living to self.&nbsp; As Jesus was the
spring, so Jesus was the aim of the whole life.&nbsp; It was
ever, &ldquo;Lord, what wilt <i>thou</i> have me to
do?&rdquo;&mdash;ever&mdash;&ldquo;Lord, not my will but
<i>thine</i> be done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brethren, <i>consider this conversation</i>&mdash;so humble,
so loving, to unselfish.&nbsp; Look at it.&nbsp; Lay your own
lives down by the side of it.&nbsp; Test them&mdash;not by what
there was of the man, but by what there was of the Master.&nbsp;
See what the testing says; and then rise up, sadder possibly by
the comparison, yet wiser&mdash;humbled, but yet hopeful.&nbsp;
For He who wrought here, works still, and loves to work, for all
who seek it at His hand.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Yet one point remains.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Consider the
end of their conversation</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know it has been said&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me how
men died, tell me how they lived.&rdquo;&nbsp; But where the
death is but the proper fruiting-out of the life it is right that
we should mark it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Precious in the sight of the Lord
is the death of his saints,&rdquo; and precious should they be in
our sight.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;end&rsquo; of our departed friend&rsquo;s
conversation was one to be considered.&nbsp; It was just what
might have been <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>expected.&nbsp; It <i>was</i> perfect peace; it
<i>is</i> present rest; it <i>will be</i> perfect glory.</p>
<p>The Lord was faithful and loving to His servant, and sustained
him to the last.&nbsp; &ldquo;Grace&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Christ&rdquo; were the two words oftenest on his
lips&mdash;testifying at once to the source of his hope, and the
security of his standing.</p>
<p>It was an end which left nothing to be desired, as the end of
a saint of God.</p>
<p>Calm, settled, unbroken confidence; devout prayerfulness; holy
self-abasement; loving consideration for and remembrance of
others; loving messages to you, his poorer brethren, loving words
for you the children in the school&mdash;of whom he said,
&ldquo;I love them all&rdquo;&mdash;these things and more than
these marked that end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was happy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;happy, but only in
Christ; not in myself, nor from myself, but only in <i>Jesus
Christ</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so he passed away.&nbsp; &ldquo;Being (to use the
descriptive words of a writer of old day) high in his communion
with God, holy and unblameable in his walkings with God&mdash;it
was still day with his soul.&nbsp; He lived and died in the joys
and comforts of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; And now that his sun is
set, his glass out, his work, done, his race over, he rests in
the everlasting arms of Divine love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now, brethren, what remains for us?&nbsp; What for me but
to speak home to your consciences?&nbsp; What for you but to act
upon what may be spoken to the point?</p>
<p>I say then&mdash;Remember the charge here given, and consider
the life of God&rsquo;s servant and its end.</p>
<p>He has been God&rsquo;s gift to His church&mdash;God&rsquo;s
gift to us in this neighbourhood, that through him our souls
might be helped on to salvation&mdash;God&rsquo;s name become
more abundantly honoured.</p>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Shall
we not take this view of him?&nbsp; Consider this, <i>you that
are Christless</i>&mdash;consciously without Christ&mdash;without
a well-grounded hope&mdash;what effect should this life and death
have on you?</p>
<p>You have watched the one, you have heard of the other.&nbsp;
You know in your heart of hearts that there has been no sham, not
a shadow of unreality.&nbsp; If ever a real Christian was to be
seen, you have seen one in him.&nbsp; There is no doubt in your
minds that he believed no lie, followed no shadow.&nbsp; You
<i>know</i> that he has found all, and more than all, that he
expected to find in Christ.</p>
<p>You feel convinced that he chose wisely when he chose for
God&mdash;because he chose a <i>certainty</i>.&nbsp; With some
here this is no new conviction.&nbsp; As friend, or neighbour, or
tenant, or servant, or labourer, you have felt him to be in the
right, and have wished to be as he was.</p>
<p>I would to God, brethren, that you felt equally convinced that
hitherto all has been <i>uncertainty</i> with you.&nbsp; Think
for one moment.&nbsp; Are not your fears more than your
hopes?&nbsp; Do you not feel sometimes that the end of your mirth
may be heaviness, the end of your pleasure pain?&nbsp; Does your
name to live give you any real satisfaction?&nbsp; Will a gained
world outweigh a lost soul?&nbsp; Have you any real settled
peace?&nbsp; Is not all vague, dark, cheerless, uncertain.</p>
<p>O that these convictions might sink down deeply into your
hearts, and bring you to the desire to be found of God in peace,
and to put aside everything that now stands in your way.</p>
<p>Only begin where he began&mdash;where he, if he were now in my
place, would urge me to begin&mdash;<i>with Christ</i>.&nbsp; Go
to the Lord Jesus this very day.&nbsp; He who received and taught
his servant, will receive and teach you, for He is the same <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>yesterday,
to-day, and for ever.&nbsp; &ldquo;This man receiveth
sinners.&nbsp; None teacheth like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Consider, <i>you that are in Christ</i>.&nbsp; You have in
this bright example a solemn but very helpful reminder.&nbsp; You
are called to aim at a higher style of Christianity&mdash;do not
despise the summons.&nbsp; You are offered the power of the Holy
Ghost&mdash;do not despond.</p>
<p>Take your stand where he took his.&nbsp; Learn to see things
as he saw them, and to hold what he held.</p>
<p>Believe more.&nbsp; Cultivate a more vigorous faith.&nbsp; Add
to your faith courage.&nbsp; Be less ashamed of Christ.</p>
<p>Be satisfied with nothing short of the manifestation of God to
your soul, and the manifestation of God by you to the
world.&nbsp; This makes life happiness, and death a joy.</p>
<p>Live so as to be missed.&nbsp; Seek to have behind you that
good name which is better than precious ointment.&nbsp; Hold
forth the word of life.&nbsp; Try to lay aside every hindrance of
selfishness, indolence, love of ease, half-heartedness.</p>
<p>Let it be said of you, as it may fitly be said of
him:&mdash;He <i>was</i> what God made him.&nbsp; He
<i>worked</i> where God placed him.&nbsp; He <i>went</i> where
God called him.&nbsp; He <i>is</i> where God in Christ is with
him&mdash;a sinner, saved by grace, through faith, in the Lord,
with an everlasting salvation.</p>

19</span>SERMON,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BY THE REV. EDWARD HOARE.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;These are they which were not defiled with
women; for they are virgins.&nbsp; These are they which follow
the Lamb withersoever he goeth.&nbsp; These were redeemed from
among men, being the first-fruits unto God and to the Lamb.&nbsp;

</blockquote>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It must have been a wonderful moment to Stephen, when he
suddenly saw the Heavens opened, and Jesus standing at the right
hand of God; and it must be equally wonderful to any departing
child of God, when the veil is drawn aside, and he finds himself
suddenly in the visible presence of that blessed Saviour whom,
though unseen, he has long since loved and trusted.&nbsp; What a
moment must it have been to our dearly beloved friend when his
eyes opened in the presence of God!&nbsp; I can imagine the
profound humiliation at the sight of Jehovah; the fervent
utterances of overpowering love, when he suddenly beheld the Lord
Jesus, as the Lamb that had been slain; and the joyful fulness of
heart in the three loved and loving brethren, when they found
themselves once more together, all brought safe home, by the rich
grace of their blessed Saviour, there to wait together for his
kingdom, and while waiting, to rejoice together in the fulness of
his love.&nbsp; Happy, indeed, are those brotherhoods on earth,
that prepare they way for such a brotherhood as, there is I am
persuaded, is in Heaven.</p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>But we
have no account in the Scriptures of the first entrance of the
individual believer, and therefore we must forbear from giving
too much liberty to the imagination.&nbsp; We have however in
this passage a description of something in many respects
corresponding to it.&nbsp; In the 7th chapter, we read of the
servants of God as represented by the 144,000 scaled ones.&nbsp;
The seal was placed on their foreheads just before the four
angels loosed the winds that were to desolate the earth.&nbsp;
Storm and tempest were about to burst upon the world; and this
little company were sealed beforehand by their God in order that,
as marked men, they might be kept safe throughout the
danger.&nbsp; Accordingly in the desolation produced by the
locust woe, when men were hurt all around them, the sealed ones
remained untouched.&nbsp; There was woe on every side, but in the
midst of it all they were kept safe by their seal.&nbsp; But in
this chapter the whole scene is changed.&nbsp; They are no longer
in the midst of a world swept by a succession of desolating woes;
no longer a bidden people struggling with difficulties on earth;
they are now taken up to Mount Zion, and this Mount Zion must be
the Heavenly Jerusalem, for, in verse 2 their voice is said to
come from Heaven, and in verse 3 they are described as before the
throne of God.&nbsp; The Saviour whom, though unseen, they have
loved and followed, is now standing conspicuous in the midst of
them.&nbsp; The seal is no longer a secret thing, but its true
character is brought to light, and the Father&rsquo;s name is
seen written on their foreheads.&nbsp; So they come before God no
longer with strong crying and tears, in the midst of strong
temptations and overwhelming woes, but now they burst forth in
the new song of the new Jerusalem.&nbsp; Nor are they alone in
singing it, for the twenty-four elders and four living ones are
described as their companions; for when the time comes for this
prophecy to be fulfilled, the family on earth will be united to
that in Heaven.&nbsp; The separation will be over.&nbsp; There
will be a blessed meeting between the sealed on earth and the
living ones in Heaven.&nbsp; Their new song will be quickened by
the joys <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>of reunion, for, according to verse 3, &ldquo;they sang
the new song not merely before the throne, but before the four
living ones and the elders.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ye, therefore, that
mourn your separation from those you dearly love, picture to
yourself that joyful gathering.&nbsp; Look on from the parting
day to the meeting day: when your wilderness journey will be
over, when you shall be caught up to meet the Lord in the air,
when those that are gone will have the joy of welcoming those
that remain, and when those that remain are taken up to enjoy
their welcome, that so both they and we may rejoice together
before the throne of the Lamb.</p>
<p>But my object to-day is not so much to dwell on the meeting,
as to study the character of the sealed servants of our
God.&nbsp; We all desire, I trust, to be amongst them on the
meeting day, and I see not, for my own part, how any wise man can
rest till he has a well grounded hope given him by God, that he
is one of the number now.&nbsp; It is most important then that we
study well their character, and may God grant that the seal may
be on our foreheads during our struggle upon earth, and the
Father&rsquo;s name clearly seen there when the Lord comes to
take the kingdom!</p>
<p>The character is given in the four descriptions of these two
verses, and I have been led to them now, because they seem to
give so faithful and true a portrait of our beloved and honoured
friend&mdash;may I not say of the three dear brothers, for in
Christian character they were one?</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; In the 1st clause there is some difficulty, because
it seems at first sight to disparage the holy tie of
matrimony&mdash;that sacred union which is a Scriptural type of
the mystical oneness which is between Christ and His
Church.&nbsp; But I am persuaded this is not the meaning of
it.&nbsp; The whole of the Book of Revelation is full of symbol;
and alliance with sin, worldliness, and popery is described in
it, <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>as in
other Scriptures, under the figure of spiritual
fornication.&nbsp; Thus the Church, the Bride of the Lord, is to
be kept free from all such alliances and presented at last as a
chaste virgin to Christ.&nbsp; But I will not dwell on this point
any further than to remark how wonderfully it was illustrated in
the case of our friend.&nbsp; There was no such thing as
unhallowed alliance in his conduct; no pandering to the world; no
dallying with popery; no attempt to win his objects by unfaithful
compromises; no mixing up with that which he disapproved.&nbsp;
He held on his way as one that was set apart unto God, as one
betrothed wholly to the Lord.&nbsp; There was a wonderful
consistency about his whole character, and he uniformly acted on
the Apostolic maxim, &ldquo;Have no fellowship with the
unfruitful works of darkness.&rdquo;&nbsp; He delighted in his
fellowship with God, and he could have no alliance with anything
contrary to God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; But, whatever we may think of the first description,
there can be no doubt about the second.&nbsp; &ldquo;These are
they that follow the Lamb, whithersoever he goeth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There is no symbolical language here, but a plain, clear,
unmistakeable, description of Christian character.&nbsp; Our Lord
describes his own sheep by this invariable test, &ldquo;They
follow me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I know them (He says) and <i>they
follow me</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He knows them.&nbsp; He knows each
one by name, by disposition, by circumstance; knows who we are,
where we are, what we are; knows all our wants, our cares, our
joys, our sorrows, our temptations; and if we be His, <i>we
follow Him</i>, seeking to know His will, watching for His
beckoning hand, listening for His directing voice, and tracing
His sacred footsteps.</p>
<p>But this text goes a step further than the words of our Lord,
for it adds the words &ldquo;whithersoever he goeth,&rdquo;
shewing that there is no reserve and no qualification.&nbsp;
Wherever the Lord leads the way, there the sealed servants <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>are prepared
to follow.&nbsp; They do not want to pick and choose for
themselves, or merely to follow in pleasant paths; still less do
they wish to be led by the leaders of the world, or guided by the
motives of the world.&nbsp; To follow the Lord Jesus Christ is
the great object of their life, to walk in His steps, to do His
will, and to live to His glory.&nbsp; Now, perhaps, some might be
disposed to say &ldquo;Have you ever known any one that has thus
followed Christ?&nbsp; Can you point to an example of such a
character?&rdquo;&nbsp; And, I believe I may safely say that I
<i>can</i>.&nbsp; I point to our honoured friend (I might add, to
all the brothers) and say, &ldquo;These are they that followed
the Lamb, whithersoever He led the way.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am not
afraid of appealing to all that knew him, to all that were
connected with him as servants in his house, or as dependants on
his estate, to all that were acquainted with him as a magistrate
and country gentleman, to all that observed him in that most
difficult and testing place of character the House of Commons; I
can appeal to all, and I am sure that when you look back on all
your intercourse with him you must admit that you never found bye
ends governing the character; but you saw a man who, with a
single and simple aim desired in everything, without reserve, to
follow Christ.&nbsp; This was the secret of his whole life.&nbsp;
Many look back on his gentleness and kind affections, many on his
princely liberality so often and so generously helping in secret
those whose wants were known only to himself, many on his holy
fidelity to the truth of God; but all sprang from one principle,
and that was &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whatever he had to do
as a father, as a master, as a friend, as steward of an ample
fortune, as a trustee for Church patronage, or as a member of
Parliament, there was one single end before him, and that was to
follow Christ.&nbsp; He could truly say as Standfast did in
&ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rdquo; &ldquo;I have loved to
hear my Lord spoken of, and wherever I have seen the print of His
shoe in the earth, there have I coveted to set my foot
too.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this I believe to be the secret of his <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>perfectly
peaceful end.&nbsp; He had not lived for the world, so he was not
disturbed when called to leave it.&nbsp; During <i>life</i> he
had walked with God, so in death he was not afraid of meeting
Him.&nbsp; For nearly fifty years he had followed the Lamb, and
no wonder that there was not a shadow of fear when the message of
love was sent to call him through the veil to see that Saviour
face to face.&nbsp; And so, dear brethren, I am persuaded it must
be with us.&nbsp; If we would die as he did, in perfect peace, we
should seek to follow Christ as he did, whithersoever He
goeth.&nbsp; God forbid that I should lead any one to suppose
that peace either in living or dying is from any source but the
free gift of God&rsquo;s grace; but as one that has witnessed
hundreds of Christian death-beds, I bear my testimony that, as a
general rule, inconsistent Christians very frequently have
anxious death-beds: while, on the other hand, those who have
walked nearest to the Lord in their life are the people who have
found Him nearest to them in their death; and those who, like our
dear friend, have set the Lord always before them, find, as he
did, the Psalmist&rsquo;s words invariably true &ldquo;Because he
is on my right hand I shall never be moved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Are we to suppose, then, that our dear and honoured friend
saved his soul by his consistency in following the Lord?&nbsp;
God forbid!&nbsp; I venture to say that there is nothing from
which his whole soul would have recoiled more than from any such
a thought, for he knew well enough that he could never save his
soul by following Christ nor by any other act of his own.&nbsp;
He never had the slightest hope of doing so, for he knew too much
of the deep corruption of his own sinful heart.&nbsp; But to
redemption and redemption alone he owed his life, as he said
himself in his last illness &ldquo;Even if I <i>could</i> say I
have walked in my integrity nothing but <i>free redemption</i>
saved me.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a poor sinner, and nothing at
all<br />
But Jesus Christ is my all in all.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The salvation came first, and faithful following was the <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>fruit of
it.&nbsp; No one will ever really follow Christ, till he is first
saved through His free grace.&nbsp; Thus in the text all is
traced to Redeeming love, for observe the next clause:&mdash;</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; &ldquo;These were redeemed from among men, being
the first-fruits unto God and the Lamb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now let us carefully observe the language of this text.&nbsp;
It clearly traces everything to atonement.&nbsp; They were
redeemed by the blood of the Lamb.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not with
corruptible things as silver and gold, but with the precious
blood of Christ, as of a Lamb without blemish and without
spot.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is no explanation of such language
except by atonement through the blood of the Lord Jesus, or the
substitution, or vicarious sacrifice of the love of God.&nbsp; If
any meaning is to be attached to words, it is impossible to
believe that our Lord&rsquo;s death was nothing more than a noble
example of devoted self sacrifice.&nbsp; It must have been the
satisfaction of the law of God by the actual infliction on the
Lord Jesus Christ of the whole penalty due to sin.&nbsp; So the
great fact that our sin has been already fully punished in his
person is the one fact on which we rest for present and
everlasting acceptance with God.&nbsp; But there is more than
that taught here, for redemption goes far beyond atonement, and
includes the actual deliverance which is the result of that
atonement, when applied to the heart by the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; It
is not merely the payment of the ransom, but the liberation of
the ransomed slave.&nbsp; Thus the sealed servants are said to
have been &ldquo;redeemed <i>from among men</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not
merely was an atonement made for them, but, through the power of
that atonement, they were delivered from the bondage of
corruption unto the glorious liberty of the children of
God.&nbsp; An atonement was made on their behalf; but that was
not all, for it was applied to their hearts by the Holy Ghost,
and the result was that they were saved and separated unto
God.&nbsp; Thus they became first-fruits to God and the
Lamb.&nbsp; The first-fruits <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>are a small portion set apart unto
God, the remainder being left in the possession of the original
owner.&nbsp; So, God&rsquo;s people are separated and dedicated
at the first-fruits onto Him, while the mass of men remain under
the power of the god of this world.&nbsp; They are mixed up with
other men in all the relationships of life; but in the midst of
all they are distinct, for God has redeemed them, and put His
seal on them, thereby to mark them as his own.&nbsp; Oh! holy
calling of the child of God.&nbsp; Oh! sacred privilege, to be
thus set apart unto the Lamb!&nbsp; How is it that any one thus
sealed can be ashamed of it?&nbsp; How is it that any child of
God can shrink from the confession of it?&nbsp; Of one thing I am
sure, and that is, our dear friend did not.&nbsp; He was not
ashamed of being a marked man for Christ!&nbsp; God had called
him.&nbsp; God had saved him.&nbsp; God had settled him!&nbsp;
God had placed him among the first-fruits of the harvest, and he
was not ashamed of it.&nbsp; But, when we look at the character,
let us never forget the ground work of all.&nbsp; I said a short
time ago that the secret of his consistency was that he followed
Christ; but there was a deeper secret still.&nbsp; There was the
secret that lay at the foundation of his following Christ, and
that was redemption.&nbsp; His own language was, &ldquo;Oh, to
grace how great a debtor.&nbsp; It was free redemption then, and
is so now.&nbsp; Wonderful!&nbsp; It is so wonderful, such a poor
sinner saved and loved!&rdquo;&nbsp; He was one redeemed,
delivered, set free, brought out, and for ever accepted through
the blood-shedding of the Son of God.&nbsp; And so, brethren,
must we be, if we are among the first-fruits unto God.&nbsp;
Nothing, nothing, nothing but the atoning blood can ever blot out
your guilt.&nbsp; As long as you are a stranger to atonement, so
long you are a stranger to God.&nbsp; If any man ever felt this,
it was our friend, our father I would rather say.&nbsp; He was a
happy man, because he was an accepted man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Happy,
quite happy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but only in Christ, not by
works of righteousness <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>which I have done, but saved by the
mercy of God in Christ.&nbsp; Such a great and blessed
salvation&mdash;so glorious to the Giver, so gracious to the
receiver.&rdquo;&nbsp; God had made atonement for him through the
precious blood of the Son of His love, and called him out to
enjoy a fellowship with Himself.&nbsp; So now, if you desire to
walk with God during life, and meet Him in peace when He summons
you; or to welcome the Lord Jesus with joy, should he come before
you die; remember, and let your affectionate recollections of our
dear friend stamp it for ever on your memory, that you must first
know what it is to be reconciled to God through the blood of
atonement before you can live near to Him, or be found among the
first-fruits of His kingdom.&nbsp; Our Lord&rsquo;s own words are
decisive on this point, &ldquo;I am the way, the truth, and the
life; no man cometh unto the Father but by me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; But we must hasten to the last clause of the
description.&nbsp; &ldquo;In their mouth was found no guile, for
they are without fault before the throne of God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here are two things mentioned&mdash;A guileless corruption before
men, and a faultless standing before God.</p>
<p>On the first I need say but little.&nbsp; You have been so
familiar with the practice, and beautiful exhibition of it in the
character of the dear brothers that you do not require a
description of it from me.&nbsp; Most truly we may say of them
all &ldquo;In their mouth was found no guile.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
was a guileless transparency of character pervading them
all.&nbsp; But we must not pass thus hastily by the remaining
clause, &ldquo;For they are without fault before the throne of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Strictly speaking these words refer exclusively
to the 144,000, when taking their place before the throne of
God.&nbsp; But surely they give us an insight into the present
standing of all those already there.&nbsp; They seem to teach us
that spotless faultlessness is like the atmosphere of <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>Heaven, and
that all before that throne are faultless.&nbsp; We may think,
then, of those we dearly love as now standing before yonder
Throne, quite faultless.&nbsp; There is no sin reckoned to them,
for it is all blotted out for ever; and no sin cleaving to them,
for they are free from its corruption, being &ldquo;made
perfect&rdquo; &ldquo;as the spirits of the just.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There is no sin there, for there are no tears; and where sin is
there is always sorrow.&nbsp; Let us be cheered, then, by the
happy thought that they are now without fault before the Throne
of God.&nbsp; But must we wait till we reach the Throne before we
can be without fault before it?&nbsp; Are we to toil on through
the wilderness, and wait till the pilgrimage is over before we
can go faultless into his presence?&nbsp; If so, the
Christian&rsquo;s life would be indeed a dreary one.&nbsp; But,
believers, ye are without fault before the Throne now, even
now!&nbsp; I verily believe that when you saw our dear friend in
the midst of you, in his farm, in his garden, in your cottages,
he was at those very times without fault before God.&nbsp; How
so? you may say.&nbsp; Did he not perpetually confess that he was
a sinner?&nbsp; Did he not acknowledge his sin, and weep for
it?&nbsp; How, then, could he be without fault?&nbsp; How could
he be a guilty sinner, and yet faultless before God?&nbsp; Hear
his own words in answer to it&mdash;&ldquo;A poor sinner in
myself, but pardoned and accepted in the beloved Son of God, and
only so, only so, Amen, only so, only so, Amen,
Amen.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, again, &ldquo;What should I do without
Christ? such a poor sinner, but complete and accepted in the
Beloved.&nbsp; Such a good foundation! such a blessed
salvation!&rdquo;&nbsp; If all his faults were cast into the
depth of the sea, and God&rsquo;s promises fulfilled which said
&ldquo;The iniquities of Israel shall be sought for and shall not
be found;&rdquo; then before that Throne he was faultless.&nbsp;
And so, if we stand in the righteousness of God, nay! if in
Christ we are made the righteousness of God, then in Him we are
faultless, faultless even now, because Christ is faultless, and
we <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>stand
in Him.&nbsp; In this connection observe the allusion to the 32nd
Psalm.&nbsp; The Revelation is full of allusions to the Old
Testament, and I cannot help thinking that here is one.&nbsp; The
same two things are mentioned in this passage and in that psalm;
the absence of guile, and the absence of all fault.&nbsp; Of the
guile the Psalmist says, &ldquo;In whose spirit there is no
guile&rdquo; and of the fault he says, &ldquo;Blessed is he whose
transgression is forgiven, and whose sin is covered.&nbsp;
Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not
iniquity,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; Here, then, is the secret of being
without fault before the Throne.&nbsp; Their transgression is
forgiven, their sin covered, and their iniquity not imputed by
God.&nbsp; Thus it is, that at the same time in the same person
there may be the two apparent opposites; in yourself deep
corruption, in the Lord Jesus Christ unblemished
spotlessness.&nbsp; Before your own conscience you may be full of
sin, and at the same time before the Throne of God perfectly
faultless: in yourself humbled to the dust; in Christ Jesus
reconciled, accepted, and beloved, and regarded as though you
were absolutely spotless; for you are without fault in the
righteousness of Christ.</p>
<p>What, then, is the conclusion of the whole matter?&nbsp; What
is the lesson to be learnt from the text? and what from the whole
history of our honoured friend?&nbsp; What is the lesson that he
would have drawn from it himself had he been here to speak to us
this day?&nbsp; I believe he would have summed it all up in one
word, <i>i.e.</i>, <span class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; This
is what he taught in his family, and made the unceasing subject
of his family worship.&nbsp; This is what he taught in the Sunday
school, and pressed with a holy perseverance on the hearts and
consciences of his class.&nbsp; This was the subject of his
addresses in the schoolroom, as well as of all his visits in the
cottages.&nbsp; In these visits he carried many a kind gift for
the body, but he always remembered his one message, <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>and was never
silent on the free grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; And do
you think he would speak less of Him now?&nbsp; Now that he sees
that blessed Saviour whom he so long believed, and has himself
experienced the actual joy of his presence?&nbsp; No, if he now
were to speak to us I am persuaded it would be all of
Christ.&nbsp; If he could give one more lesson to his class it
would be to assure them that the half had never yet been told
them, and that there is a joy in Christ of which he had known
here only just the small beginning.&nbsp; If he were to speak to
you young men he would tell you there is nothing that can ever
satisfy your soul but Christ.&nbsp; Life may now seem very bright
to you; but there are days of mourning before you as well as days
of rejoicing, and there is nothing but Christ then can either
save or satisfy your soul.&nbsp; And so, if He were to speak to
you mourners it would still be the same thing to you.&nbsp; How
would he tell of the balm of Gilead for the wounded heart, and of
the great purpose of God, surely doing all things well for the
eternal life of His chosen people! and once more, if he were to
speak to those amongst us who are still unchanged, still
unconverted, still without the new birth, still without Christ,
how would he press upon you the great atonement made on the Cross
for every guilty sinner; and how would he weep over the hard
impenitent hearts that remain unmoved, unsoftened, unsaved by His
grace!&nbsp; But we cannot hear his voice: it is now silent upon
earth, and must remain so till the Lord comes.&nbsp; His
thanksgivings are now heard only in Heaven.&nbsp; But the
unmistakeable testimony remains, and may God so write it on our
hearts, that when we are called, as he has been, to give up our
great account, we may be found, as I am persuaded he is, without
fault before the Throne of God.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
